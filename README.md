This is a custom status discord bot that can check the status of your discord bots by bot id.

```bash
1. Add your discord status bot token, bot ids that you want the status to show the status of your discord bots and the channel id for your discord status bot to post in your discord server channel which is required in the bot.py file.
2. pip install requirements.txt
3. python bot.py
4. Enjoy!
